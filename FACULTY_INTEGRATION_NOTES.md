# Faculty Portal Integration Notes

## Overview
The student attendance system is ready and waiting for faculty portal integration. The student side is complete and functional.

## Current Status
✅ **Student Portal - COMPLETE**
- View attendance records (absent/tardy only)
- Apply reasons for absences/tardiness  
- Readmission records display
- Real-time UI updates

⏳ **Faculty Portal - WAITING FOR INTEGRATION**
- Real-time attendance marking during class
- Backend database updates
- Student notification system

## Integration Points

### 1. Faculty Attendance Marking
**Location**: `DataManager.updateAttendanceRecord()`
**Purpose**: Faculty will mark students as Present/Absent/Late during class
**Status**: PLACEHOLDER - waiting for faculty portal code

```java
// This method will be implemented when faculty portal is ready
public static boolean updateAttendanceRecord(String studentID, String subjectCode, 
        String subjectName, java.time.LocalDate date, String status, String remarks)
```

### 2. Real-time Updates
- Faculty marks attendance → Immediately updates `attendanceRecords.txt`
- Student portal refreshes → Shows new absent/tardy records instantly
- Students can apply reasons for new absences/tardiness

### 3. Data Flow
```
Faculty Portal → updateAttendanceRecord() → attendanceRecords.txt → Student Portal
Student Portal → submitAttendanceReason() → attendanceRecords.txt → Faculty Portal
```

## Files Ready for Integration

### Student Side (Complete)
- `ISLUStudentPortal.java` - Attendance UI and reason submission
- `DataManager.java` - Data handling methods
- `AttendanceRecord.java` - Data structure
- `attendanceRecords.txt` - Data storage

### Faculty Side (Waiting)

## Next Steps
1. ✅ Student attendance system is ready

4. 🧪 Test real-time attendance flow
5. 🚀 Deploy complete system
